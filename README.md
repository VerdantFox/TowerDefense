# TwistedTowers
A tower defense game built in python's Pygame library.


To start the game from source, launch main.py. 
Python 3, and Pygame 1.9.3 required.

In game, enemies will travel along the dirt path toward the castle. The player 
can defend against enemies by building towers. Towers are constructed by 
left-clicking circles on the ground, and then clicking the adjacent circles
that appear next to the first circle clicked. The game is lost if enough 
enemies reach the castle. The game is won if the player survives long enough 
for the hero mage to come to the rescue. Information on enemies and towers can 
be found in tabs in the main menu.

Have fun :-)
